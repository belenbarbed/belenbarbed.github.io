            <li>1/2 tsp pepper</li>
            
        </ul>
        <p>Method:</p>
        <ol>
            
            <li>Soak the dried shrimps for at least 1h</li>
            
            <li>Boil the grease and wax off the sausages, then peel and finely chop.</li>
            
            <li>Stir fry the shrimps, setting aside their water, until aromatic.</li>
            
            <li>Add in the sausages until aromatic, then set aside.</li>
            
            <li>Peel the radish until you see the netting, keeping about 80%.</li>
            
            <li>Cut into chuncks, then grate it into a bowl.</li>
            
            <li>Using your hands, pick up the solid pieces of radish, squeezing the juice out of them back into the bowl, setting the dried radish aside.</li>
            
            <li>Add the flours and shrimp water into the radish juice, and mix until it becomes a batter.</li>
            
            <li>Sautee the dry radish in a wok, and season with the salt, pepper, sugar, and chicken powder.</li>
            
            <li>Add 3/4 of the meat and shrimp, and continue cooking.</li>
            
            <li>Set to low heat, and add the batter in.</li>
            
            <li>Cook until the dough has reduced and become sticky.</li>
            
            <li>Place in oiled trays, and steam for 45 mins or until an inserted chopstick comes out clean.</li>
            
            <li>Cut into pieces and stir fry, serve with the remaining sausage and shrimp on top. Hoisin or sweet chilli sauce pairs well.</li>
            
        </ol>
