            <li>Brown the butter in a pan, taking care not to burn the milk solids.</li>
            
            <li>Combine the butter, browned butter, salt, and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer. Mix well for 2-3 mins.</li>
            
            <li>Meanwhile, combine the flour and cornstarch in a bowl. Whisk well to combine.</li>
            
            <li>Add half of the dry ingredients and continue mixing for 30s.</li>
            
            <li>Add the remaining dry ingredients and mix until a crumbly dough forms.</li>
            
            <li>Transfer the dough to the prepared pan and gently press it into the sides and corners of the tray.</li>
            
            <li>Top the shortbread with the rest of the coating sugar.</li>
            
            <li>Bake for 1h - 1.5h at 150&ordm;C or until the top is set and has become lightly golden.</li>
            
            <li>Allow the shortbread to cool for 10-15 mins before cutting, and a little more before serving.</li>
            
        </ol>
